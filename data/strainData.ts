        description: 'OG Kush was first cultivated in Florida, in the early ‘90s when a strain from Northern California was crossed with a Hindu Kush plant from Amsterdam. The result was a hybrid with a unique terpene profile that boasts a complex aroma with notes of fuel, skunk, and spice. The genetic backbone of West Coast cannabis varieties, OG Kush arrived in Los Angeles in 1996 when Matt “Bubba” Berger brought it (along with “The Bubba,” which was later used to create the famed Bubba Kush) from Florida to legendary cultivator Josh D. Since then, OG Kush has become a worldwide staple used to create numerous famous strains like GSC and Headband. There are many different phenotypes of OG Kush, some of which include Tahoe OG, SFV OG, and Alpha OG.',

        description: 'Gorilla Glue, also known as “Gorilla Glue #1” or "420 Glue" is an indica dominant hybrid (60% indica/40% sativa) strain created through crossing the classic Chocolate Diesel X Sour Diesel strains. This bud packs a crazy powerful high that leaves you feeling like your mind is filled with glue, all fueled by an insanely potent 25-28% average THC level. The high starts with a cerebral rush that leaves you feeling happy yet totally hazy, with no hope of focusing on anything any time soon. As your head high build and builds, your body will be washed over with a deep body buzz, leaving you feeling completely stoned and immovable. These effects last for hours on end and often end in a deep sleep for the lesser experienced. Because of these effects, Gorilla Glue is said to be perfect for treating conditions such as chronic pain, depression, insomnia, nausea, and muscle spasms. This bud has a super sour diesel chemical flavor that’s incredibly harsh and sticks to your tongue long after you finish toking. The aroma is even more powerful, with a slightly sweet sour mocha effect that’s accented by chemical diesel. Gorilla Glue buds have small round piecey dark olive green nugs with purple undertones and a super frosty coating of tiny white crystal trichomes.',
